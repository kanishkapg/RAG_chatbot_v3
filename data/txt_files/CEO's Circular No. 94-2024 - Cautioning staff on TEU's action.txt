26th November 2024

To All Staff,

Cautioning Staff on Telecommunication Engineers' Union's (TEU) Action

We learnt that Telecommunication Engineers' Union (TEU) has sent out a communication via email to their membership on November 25, 2024, requesting TEU Members to adhere to a campaign of non-cooperation and a Work to Rule.

Please note that the instructions given by the TEU to SLT employees (TEU Members) are illegal and also undermine the authority of management. As such, any personnel participating in such action would be liable for disciplinary action on the basis of breaching company policy / laws of this country.

Therefore, we kindly request all staff not to be misled and to ensure that they attend to their duties and functions without fail.

It is noteworthy to mention that the Company has improved its performance in the recent past by posting a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 1,093 Million for Q3 2024, and any disruptions to its business and operations will result in negative impact on its service to customers, benefits to staff, shareholder value, Company performance and company's brand image

Therefore, we kindly request all staff to attend to their duties as usual, to ensure a smooth functioning of SLT Business and Operations.

Janaka R. Abeysinghe
Chief Executive Officer
