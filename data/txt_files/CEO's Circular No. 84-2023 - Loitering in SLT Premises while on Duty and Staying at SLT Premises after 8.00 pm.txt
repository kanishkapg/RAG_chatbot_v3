This is further to the CEO’s Circular No: 83/2005 dated 10.10.2005 regarding “Loitering in SLT HQ & Staying at SLT HQ After Duties” (Annexure I).

It has been reported to the management about many incidences involving SLT employees and some non-SLT personnel, linked with theft of company property, being inside **SLT Premises** under the influence of liquor, indulging in activities that violate the privacy of fellow employees, spending the night at **SLT Premises** without obtaining prior permission of the authorized officer etc. These practices have created many administrative and security issues to the company.

Under these circumstances, only the SLT employees and non-SLT personnel (e.g. Contractors) who have obtained prior permission from relevant SLT authorities shall be allowed to occupy “SLT Premises” (SLT HQ, Regional SLT office premises, Equipment Rooms, Tower Premises and/or any property or premises that belong to SLT) after 8 p.m.

Hence, it is essential to enforce the company rules with regard to occupying **SLT Premises** with strict security measures.

It is re-iterated the fact that staying at SLT HQ after 8 p.m. and loitering inside HQ premises during duty hours are prohibited as a policy.

Following instructions will come into force with immediate effect:

1. In addition to what is mentioned in the said circular issued in 2005, it is emphasized that employees, (except those who are on duty), and non-SLT personnel such as Contractors, are prohibited from staying in **SLT Premises** after 8 p.m. without obtaining prior permission from the relevant executive supervising officer.

The relevant executive supervising officer shall send a list of names and the relevant ID Nos of employees/persons deployed in night duties after 8.00 p.m. to Security Unit by addressing to the Duty Officer on or before 4.00 p.m., daily. This will not be applicable to employees who are listed in shift duty rosters.

2. Employees are prohibited from loitering inside **SLT Premises** during office hours.

If any employee, under any special circumstances, has a need to stay beyond 10.30 p.m. on any day, to attend to a non-duty related activity, he/she should obtain prior approval from CPO with proper justifications and recommendations of the President or Secretary of such SLT Club, Association, Trade Union etc. This approval should be obtained for each day.

The Security staff is hereby authorized and empowered to maintain security within all SLT Premises. Further, the Security staff is accountable to ensure that no SLT employee or any non-SLT personnel such as contractors etc., will stay in SLT Premises without prior valid permission from the relevant executive supervising officer, as indicated above under Items 1 to 4.

Following instruction will come into force with effect from 01st December 2023:

a. The informal and flexible arrangements granted to SLT employees to ensure smooth operations during the Covid period by allowing them to occupy SLT Premises after duty hours will cease and become null and void. A Grace Period is granted until 30th November 2023, for employees to make necessary arrangements to comply with this directive.

All staff of SLT shall strictly adhere to these instructions in order for the management to carry out proper administration at SLT and to maintain security of SLT Premises. Any employee who violates these instructions will be severely dealt with according to the SLT Disciplinary Procedure. The relevant supervising officers are accountable for the adherence of their subordinates to this Circular.

CEO's Office, SLT Headquarters, Colombo 01: 10th October 2005.

All Employees.

LOTTERING IN SLT HQ & STAYING AT SLT HQ AFTER DUTIES

It has been observed that some employees have made it a habit to stay at SLT Headquarters after duties, while some employees have a practice to lottel even during office hours. These practices have created many administrative and security problems to the company.

Therefore, employees except those who are on duty, are prohibited from staying at SLT Headquarters after 8.00 pm in principle with effect from 15th of October 2005. The supervising officers and security staff are requested to closely monitor this matter.

A list of names and the relevant ID Nos of night duty personnel should be sent to Security Division before 4.00 pm daily. This should be strictly adhered in order to strengthen the security of all personnel, plants and buildings in SLT Headquarters.
