To All Staff,

Adhering to Organizational Policies, Procedures and Professional Conduct of Employees

In recent past, we have observed some of our employees resorting to use political influences in order to fulfill employment related requests i.e. Employment, transfers, promotions etc.

In this connection, we wish to reinstate that, the management will continue to abide by the company policies and procedures established for staff recruitment, transfers, promotions and other employment related activities. Every employee has also been granted the freedom to raise concerns and grievances through set provisions available within above Organizational Policies and Procedures.

Thus, any form of influence i.e. political influences interfering or attempting to interfere in the performance of official duties within the organization is considered an act against the Organizational Policies, Procedures and would lead to disciplinary procedures against such employees.

Therefore, all employees are hereby advised to forward any such requests or grievances only through the official channels given within the respective Company Policies and Procedures.

The management wishes to reiterate that the company would be compelled to take strict action against any employee who violates any Company Policy or Procedure.
