PAYMENT OF CASH ADVANCE - APRIL 2023

Prevailing socio-economic conditions and the intense market competition have created enormous challenges on company revenue, collections and expenditure. Despite these challenges, the management has continued to provide benefits enjoyed by the SLT staff to maintain their financial stability. Further the SLT management is pleased to acknowledge and recognize determination, passion and commitment of staff devoted to managing our services while providing the best experience to our customers.

I am pleased to inform that the Board of Directors has approved a cash advance payment of One (01) month basic salary in April 2023 subject to a minimum of LKR 70,000/- as an advance payment of bonus to all SLT permanent staff and employees who were recruited on contract basis from HCS to SLT (under the intake of June 2020). This cash advance will be deducted from the year-end annual bonus for the year 2023, which will be decided based on the company and individual performances. This cash advance will be paid during the first week of April 2023 in complying with the other terms and conditions stipulated in related policy documents of the company.

I would take this opportunity to thank all of you for your valuable contribution and dedication during this year. We can achieve organizational business objectives in the year 2023 with your continued support, our joint efforts, staying focused on our priorities and putting our customers first.

I wish all SLT employees and members of their families a happy and a prosperous Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
