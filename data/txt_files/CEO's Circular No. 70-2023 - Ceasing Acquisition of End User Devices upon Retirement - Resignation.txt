To All Staff,

CEASING ACQUISITION OF END USER DEVICES UPON RETIREMENT / RESIGNATION

The company and the telecommunication industry are facing a challenging situation due to high inflation, high interest rates, and rupee devaluation. The majority of people and business in the country are facing an unprecedented economic crisis, and the spending on communication facilities is decreasing rapidly.

As a result, an important decision was taken in our company’s policy regarding the acquisition of End User Devices upon retirement/resignation. After consideration and evaluation of our resources and present and future needs, company has made the decision to cease the provision of end-user devices to employees upon retirement/resignation, with immediate effect.

Considering the current financial challenges our company is facing, it became imperative for us to optimize our expenses. By discontinuing the acquisition of end-user devices upon retirement/resignation, we can redirect the same resources to needy employees whereby reduce some of the capex investments to run operations smoothly.

Thank you for your unwavering dedication and commitment to our company. Your hard work and contributions are greatly appreciated, and we remain confident in our ability to overcome these challenges together.

Chief Executive Officer
