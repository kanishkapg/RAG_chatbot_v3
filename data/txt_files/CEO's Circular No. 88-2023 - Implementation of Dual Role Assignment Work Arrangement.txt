SLT has been experiencing higher staff turnover among many professionals. In the recent past, it is observed that the highly skilled graduates and professionals in some identified disciplines have left the organization. Therefore, it is vital to manage the situation which will allow the company to continue its operations without difficulties. In order to overcome this situation, it has been required to formulate new or alternative business/operations models to fill the critical staffing requirements.

Considering the situation, Management has decided to introduce the dual role assignment work arrangement across the organization. Dual role assignment work arrangement refers to a situation where an individual is assigned or takes on two distinct roles and responsibilities within the organization or context. This can occur in various settings within the organization.

When an employee is selected for a dual role assignment, the staff member has the full accountability and total responsibility against the expected KPIs from both the roles. Further, individuals need to balance their time and efforts effectively to fulfill the expectations associated with both duties. Further, it is important to set clear boundaries, communicate openly, and prioritize tasks to prevent conflicts between the job roles in such situations.

Key benefits to an employee,

- Recognition to the employee.
- Create additional income as 20% extra payment shall be done for the selected staff.
- Get an experience in different job roles and opportunity for job enrichment.
- This would be considered at performance appraisal.
