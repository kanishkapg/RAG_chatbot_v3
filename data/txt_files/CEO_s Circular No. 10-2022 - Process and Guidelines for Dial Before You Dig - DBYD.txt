INTRODUCING "DIAL BEFORE YOU DIG – DBYD"

SLT, as National Telecommunication Services Provider has its fiber network across the Country. The wired network has been laid overhead as well as underground, in its duct routes which has been built along the road sides. At the same time, we understand that roads are frequently digged for various activities like road widening, rehabilitations, construction & maintenance of networks by other agencies such as water supply, drainage, CEB and municipalities. Therefore, "Dial Before You Dig" program is introduced to have central coordination for preventing any damages to underground networks when someone wants to dig the road.

By way of an established process and a mechanism, it would be possible to minimize unwanted disturbances to services, while ensuring increased customer satisfaction and cost savings for restoring damages due to unplanned digging of the roads by various agencies. Further, this will help to enhance management of infrastructure along the roads and improve coordination between utility agencies in the country.

Therefore, "Dial Before You Dig" program will be launched with the patronage of Government of Sri Lanka nationally, and process of the activities involved herewith are discussed below. In the phase 1, it will be launched to protect SLT network from such damages and following actions are being taken.

The short code will be published and notified to all the related agencies with the advice to share with third parties who are involved for road digging activities. Contact Center will notify the other agencies as well as depending based on the requirement
