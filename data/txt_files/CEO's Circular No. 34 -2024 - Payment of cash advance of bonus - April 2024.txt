To: All SLT, Mobitel and SLT Group Subsidiary Staff,

PAYMENT OF CASH ADVANCE OF BONUS – APRIL 2024

In light of the prevailing socio-economic conditions and heightened market competition, SLT Group faces substantial challenges concerning revenue, customer retention, and expenditure. Despite these obstacles, the management remains committed to ensuring the financial stability of our staff by maintaining their benefits.

SLT Board has approved to disburse a cash advance payment equivalent to 3/4 month basic salary subject to a minimum of LKR 50,000 to all the eligible employees of SLT, Mobitel and SLT Group subsidiary staff. The payment will be made in the first week of April 2024 in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the company's policy documents.

This advance portion of the 2024 bonus will be paid to all the eligible permanent staff of SLT Group and employees recruited on a contract basis from HCS to SLT (under the intake of June 2020). This advance will be deducted from the year-end annual bonus for 2024 which will be determined based on the Company's performance.

I am looking forward to the invaluable contribution and dedication of each one of you throughout this year. With your continued support, collaborative efforts, focus on priorities, and continued dedication to customer satisfaction, we are poised to achieve our organizational objectives in 2024.

I extend my warmest wishes for a happy and a prosperous Sinhala and Hindu New Year to all employees and their families of the SLT Group.

Janaka R. Abeysinghe
Chief Executive Officer
