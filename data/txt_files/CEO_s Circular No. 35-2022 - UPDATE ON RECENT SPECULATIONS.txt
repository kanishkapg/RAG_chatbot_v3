UPDATE ON RECENT SPECULATIONS

The management is of the view that it is the duty of the management to make the employees aware of the current status of the company to prevent the employees being misinformed with the false information.

1. There was a recent newspaper article on the sale of shares of SLT PLC. The management has already made clarifications on the said publication to all Trade Unions of SLT and there is no reason to have undue fear on the same. SLT PLC is a listed company having its shares traded on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the SLT management assures all employees the stability of the organization, smooth operation and the wellbeing of the employees.

2. SLT PLC is managing a Private Provident Fund (PPF) via a transparent management mechanism under the strict governance of the Committee of Management. The SLT PLC Provident Fund is under the custody of the company and SLT PLC which shall be the custodian Trustee of the said Fund. Hence the management of SLT gives an assurance to all staff that there will be no adverse impact on the management of PPF of SLT PLC due to any external implications.

Further due to rising inflation, the management is in the process of rectifying the salary anomaly and in the process of finalizing the increments to the allowances. SLT Management trust that all SLT staff will work towards one goal as one family and will avoid engaging in any activities detrimental to the organization.

I reiterate that all staff not to be misled by malicious information and to ignore any attempts to force you to take any inappropriate actions against your best judgement or against your will.
