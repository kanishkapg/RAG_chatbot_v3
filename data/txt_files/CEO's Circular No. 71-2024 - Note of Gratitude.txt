To All Staff,

Note of Gratitude

We have noticed that some employees have applied for leave and stayed away from their workplaces on
25th July 2024.

However, the majority of our employees stayed in their workplace and continued to provide their services
on that day. In challenging situations, such exemplary actions define us, and your dedication and
perseverance exemplify the true ethos of our company. We are proud to have such a dedicated and
hardworking team and I wish to let you know that your loyalty is greatly appreciated.

SLT Management trusts that all staff at SLT will avoid engaging in any harmful and disruptive activities
detrimental to the organization’s smooth operation. Such harmful activities will reduce the growth of our
company, and will benefit our competitors.

Your decision to continue working on that day, has helped us to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted business
operation. Your commitment has enabled SLT to maintain a satisfactory level of service to our customers,
to meet our operational requirements and to minimize any adverse impact to our brand image.

I take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for the exceptional support and unwavering
commitment shown by those who continued working for SLT on 25th July 2024. Reiterating that the support
of all employees is essential to our esteemed organization, let us resolve to rally round as One Team and
work together towards the success of SLT.
