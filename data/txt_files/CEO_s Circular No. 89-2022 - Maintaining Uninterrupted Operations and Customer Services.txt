**To All Staff,**

**MAINTAINING UNINTERRUPTED OPERATIONS & CUSTOMER SERVICES**

SLT's operation is essential for the continuation of the critical services and business activities in the country.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of all employees to discharge their assigned business/operational duties
without an interruption by adhering to the assigned mode of work.

Despite the cost escalations in the recent past, the management has continued to provide benefits enjoyed by
the SLT staff to maintain their financial stability, which is contributed by the organizational brand image,
reputation and stakeholder confidence. Any interruption to the operations of the company and the customer
service will have adverse effects on the benefits to employees, dividends to shareholders and will also
adversely impact the future of the company.

The management has already made all the measures to continue the business and operations of the company in
the usual manner without any disruption. Further, all the Chief Officers, the Regional, Divisional and the
**Sectional management are empowered to take the business and operational decisions to ensure business**
**continuity of the company.**

**The management seeks cooperation of all staff to refrain from engaging in any activity which is**
**detrimental to the interests of the company and to report to their workstations and assigned duties as**
**directed by their immediate supervisors to maintain uninterrupted operations and customer services.**
