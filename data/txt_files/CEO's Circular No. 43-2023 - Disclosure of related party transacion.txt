Disclosure of Related Party Transactions

In terms of Section 9 of the CSE Listing Rules it is mandatory for all listed entities to disclose its related party transactions. The Related Party Transaction Review Committee (“RPTRC”) set up for this purpose will review and recommend to the Board matters relating to such transactions.

The objective of these Related Party Transactions rules is to ensure that the Company does not engage in transactions with “related parties” in a manner that would grant such parties “more favorable treatment” than that accorded to third parties in the normal course of business of the entity.

In terms of the Code of Best Practices on Related Party Transactions issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and the Code of Best Practices on Corporate Governance (2017) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the terms “related party” and “related party transactions” carry the same meaning as defined in the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards LKAS 24.

Definition:

As defined in LKAS 24, a related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (in this Standard referred to as the ‘reporting entity’).

(a) A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that person:
i. has control or joint control over the reporting entity;
ii. has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
iii. is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.

(b) An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:
i. The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).
ii. One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
iii. Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
iv. One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.
v. The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity.
vi. The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).
vii. A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity)

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements ('reporting entity').

A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged.

Close members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected to influence, or be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity and include:

(a) that person's children and spouse or domestic partner;
(b) children of that person's spouse or domestic partner; and
(c) dependents of that person or that person's spouse or domestic partner.

General Manager and above staff of SLT and its subsidiaries are considered as Key Management Personnel (KMP). Accordingly, in view of the above, all the KMPs are requested to provide the information indicated in the Statement of related party (Annexure 01) once in each quarter, when there is a change in the status and in any event prior to entering into any transactions between such related parties and the Company, its parent or any subsidiaries, sub-subsidiaries, associates, etc. All KMPs shall make an initial disclosure by providing details of all their related parties on or before 15th July 2023 to the Group Company Secretary. Based on the information provided Finance Group shall report quarterly to RPTRC the related party transactions of KMPs.

It is the responsibility and the accountability of the respective KMPs to ensure the accuracy of the disclosure requirements for related party transactions.
