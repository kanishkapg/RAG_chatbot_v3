23rd October 2023

To: All Executive Staff

ESTABLISHMENT OF GROUP INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

Investment Governance Framework at SLT was formally established to oversee investment management across the group of companies, incorporating a stage gate process. This entails regular assessments and oversight of project progress at every stage. This governance structure is pivotal to ensuring viability and return on investment (ROI) of capital projects. Furthermore, it aims to prioritize projects based on their benefits and strategic significance to the business, ultimately driving value creation.

Currently, the investment governance framework comprises Functional Investment Management Committees (FIMCs) namely, PPIMC (Project Portfolio Investment Management Committee), PIMC (Product Investment Management Committee), EIMC (Enterprise Solutions Investment Management Committee), and DPAC (Direct Procurement Approval Committee). These committees operate under the oversight of the Strategic Investment Management Committee (SIMC).

The IMCs’ primary responsibilities and functions lie in conducting thorough assessments of project business cases and budgeting, which are integral to evaluating projects and overseeing investments across the SLTMobitel group.

In light of recent organizational structural adjustments, significant alterations have been introduced to the composition of IMCs. These changes were implemented with the aim of aligning committee members' expertise more closely with the evolving objectives of the organization. Furthermore, the roles and responsibilities of IMC members, project managers and project sponsors are outlined in the updated annexures listed below.

- Annex (1): Introduction to the Enhanced Investment Governance Framework
- Annex (2): Introduction to Investment Management Committees
- Annex (3): High Level Business Processes of SIMC

(Please find above annexures at, Insite → Home → General → Investment Management Framework → Investment Governance Framework Guidelines)

This circular supersedes CEO's Circular No: 81/2022. All relevant officers are hereby requested to adhere to the guidelines and directions given in this circular and its annexures with immediate effect.
