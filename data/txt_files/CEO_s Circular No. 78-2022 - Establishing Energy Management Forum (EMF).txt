ESTABLISHING ENERGY MANAGEMENT FORUM (EMF)

The Management Committee of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC has identified the need of optimizing energy usage and implementing energy conservation activities across the organization, especially during the prevailing energy crisis in Sri Lanka. A holistic approach that has been identified will be implemented across the company through a cross-functional team.

In order to meet the current challenges in competition, we have to capitalize all opportunities to manage our costs efficiently to enhance profitability. While we are examining all areas of company expenditure for such opportunities, energy management has been identified as a key interest area.

Systematic management of energy will not only reduce our operational expenditure, but also positively contribute to conserve our environment through reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This will further strengthen SLT as a responsible corporate citizen, which favorably contribute to the environment by managing energy demand.

At present, SLT incurs a significant expenditure for energy in the form of Electricity, Fuel, and other utilities such as water. Hence, SLT Management has decided to strengthen the energy management activities with renewed strategies to reduce operational cost and carbon footprint.

It is a key responsibility and a moral obligation of all employees to actively participate to conserve energy and use it efficiently and effectively. All employees are kindly requested to take up this challenge in reducing our energy usage through careful & regular attention, which will contribute the company and for a greener world.
