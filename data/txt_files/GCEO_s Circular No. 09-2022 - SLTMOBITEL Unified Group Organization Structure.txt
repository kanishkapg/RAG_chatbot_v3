To All Staff,

SLT MOBITEL UNIFIED GROUP ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

SLT Mobitel started its One Face to the Customer journey with the brand unification in January 2021. The first steps of backward integration were taken with the creation of the Joint SLT Mobitel Working Group (JTMWG). JTMWG has made tremendous progress.

Now, in order to streamline operations completely, establishment of a unified organization structure is imperative. As the Group transforms itself from a Telco to a Techco, achieving operational and business efficiencies requires an aligned organization structure.

Accordingly, the Unified Group Organization Structure depicted in the attached Annexure will be effective 14th January 2023. Further steps as required in this journey will be taken in 2023.

All Group Heads are expected to carry out any operational tasks assigned by COO & Head of Group Assets Monetization & Sustainable Energy, from time to time.

GCEO, CEO (SLT) and CEO (Mobitel) will have further communications with the Group Heads and other relevant senior staff, to address any clarifications.

Reporting structures of Sri Lanka Telecom (Services) Ltd, SLT Digital Info Services (Pvt) Ltd, Talentfort (Pvt) Ltd and SLT Visioncom (Pvt) Ltd will remain unchanged.
