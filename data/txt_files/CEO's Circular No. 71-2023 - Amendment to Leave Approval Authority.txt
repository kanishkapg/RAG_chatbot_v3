Amendment of Leave Approval Authority

As per the CEO’s Circular No: 10/2019 dated 31st January 2019, requests of employee to obtain leave shall be recommended by the respective immediate supervisor and approved by the relevant CXO/DCXO/GMM/DGMM/RTOMM/M-OPMC.

To maintain a smooth administrative workflow, it has been decided to revise the leave approval authority such that the leave requests of employees will be forwarded via ERP to the respective Immediate Executive Supervising Officer (A5 and above) for the direct approval. All respective supervisors are responsible & accountable for keeping uninterrupted service and maintaining KPI.

This arrangement will be implemented with immediate effect and the relevant process changes will be implemented in ERP accordingly.
