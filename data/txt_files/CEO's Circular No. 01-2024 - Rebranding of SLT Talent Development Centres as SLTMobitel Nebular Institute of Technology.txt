To All Staff,

Rebranding of SLT Talent Development Centres as SLT-MOBITEL Nebula Institute of Technology

Over the years, SLT Talent Development Centre (SLTTDC) has been expanded considerably, introducing cutting-edge training programs to SLT employees and the general public. By considering the potential of SLTTDC and increasing competitiveness in education sector, it has been decided to rebrand and reposition SLTTDC as the leading educational institute in technical education.

Accordingly, SLTTDC will be rebranded as “SLT-MOBITEL Nebula Institute of Technology” with immediate effect. Therefore, in all future internal and external communications, SLTTDC will be named as SLT-MOBITEL Nebula Institute of Technology (SLTMNIT). However, SLTMNIT will remain as a section under the Human Capital Development Division.

In line with the rebranding, the position of Deputy General Manager/Talent Development Centre will be renamed as Deputy General Manager/SLT-MOBITEL Nebula Institute of Technology, with effect from 1st of January 2024.

The new logo and new website of SLT-MOBITEL Nebula Institute of Technology are as follows.
