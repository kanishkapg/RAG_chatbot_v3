To All SLT Employees,

INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE CALIBRATION

Please be informed that the management has decided to introduce the Performance Calibration process with immediate effect. Performance Calibration is a systematic process that improves consistency and fairness in evaluating employee performance. It involves comparing, discussing, justifying, and aligning individual performance ratings or scores across different evaluators or raters within the section/division/group. Given below are the outline of the performance calibration process:

1. Establishing Performance Calibration Committee:
   Following committees are established and empowered to make any changes on individual performance ratings after the calibration.

| Calibration Level | Performer Group         | Supervisor Group    | Calibration Committee               |
|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Division          | DGMs & GMs             | Relevant CXO        | CXOs, CPO and CEO.                  |
| Section           | All other executive staff and non-executives staff. | Relevant DGM        | GMs in the group, relevant CXO and DCPO/CPO. |

2. Conducting Calibration meeting by the committee:
   During the calibration meeting, participants review and discuss the performance data for each employee. This includes sharing examples of specific achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement: Accordingly, relevant Supervisor (Manager or above Officer) should submit at least 03 reasons (using the specimen attached as Annexure 1) for each employee for the ratings given 'Outstanding' (5), 'Need Improvements, (02) and 'Unsatisfactory' (1). The committee will consider each rating case by case and will do the calibration accordingly. This calibration will involve assessing overall aspects of sectional/divisional/group level achievements adherence to the company targets.

3. Schedule Calibration Meetings:
   Once preliminary ratings are assigned, calibration meetings should be scheduled at the divisional/group level, respective GM/CXO is held accountable for completing calibration process for each division/group. These meetings should involve the committee members stated in the item 1 above.

4. Adjust Ratings if Necessary:
   Based on the discussions and comparisons, calibration committee has the authority to adjust the preliminary ratings to ensure fairness and consistency. This adjustment process helps align ratings across different teams in the division/group and ratings reflect a collective agreement reached during the calibration meeting.

5. Follow-Up and Monitoring:
Following the performance calibration process, relevant managers should provide ongoing feedback (especially if any changes of the preliminary rating) to the employee, continue to monitor employee performance, and support development initiatives as needed.

6. Finalize Ratings:
Once adjustments are made, final rating will be determined for each employee. Accordingly, final rating should be updated in the ERP system during the 'Performance Grade Finalization' stage. After the calibration, finalized rating should be updated in the ERP system on or before 12th March 2024.
By implementing performance calibration process, management expects the organization can promote fairness, transparency, and objectivity in evaluating employee performance, ultimately contributing to a positive work environment, instilling performance driven culture and driving overall organizational success.
