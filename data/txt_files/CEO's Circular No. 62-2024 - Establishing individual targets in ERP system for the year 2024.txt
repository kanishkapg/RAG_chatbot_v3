All executive supervising officers are requested to educate their subordinates on the KPI setting procedure and to facilitate the process via ERP.

The following directions will guide you in establishing, achieving and monitoring targets & objectives for your staff:

- All Chief Officers should establish individual targets and objectives for their subordinates in line with the company Annual Business Plan (ABP). Accordingly Group's ABP targets should be cascaded into each General Manager, Deputy General Manager and all staff reporting below them.

- KPIs recommended by the Management/ABP for each group shall be taken into consideration when establishing individual KPIs.

- All supervising officers are responsible to establish KPIs to all their subordinates. Supervising officers also should ensure update their subordinates' KPIs and assignment of supervisor peers in ERP system.

- CEO and Chief Officers will peer audit DGM and above officers to ensure cross functional alignment of ABP objectives with operational plans and staff responsibilities on KPIs.

- KPIs must be defined by considering the short term and long term goals of the group and they should be defined based on the targets in ABP 2024 and respective divisional & sectional operational plans should be linked to ABP 2024 targets.

- Individual targets/KPIs have to be SMART and linked to operational plan targets.
  - Specific (no ambiguity)
  - Measurable (in terms of time, number, volume or value)
  - Agreed (mutually agreed)
  - Realistic (can be particularly attainable, but only with an extra effort)
  - Time- bound (must have a time schedule)

- They should be defined as appropriate for each employee under the following key areas.
  - Customer
  - Financial
  - Internal Business Processes
  - Learning & Growth

- Achievement of individual KPIs should be monitored frequently (ideally monthly) by all reporting officers. Employees should discuss their KPIs and progress with their reporting officers regularly. These documents should be made available for management reference at any time.

- Reviewing Officers should monitor the progress of performance throughout the year. Progress and negative deviations (if any) should be monitored continuously and corrective measures should be taken with the help of respective reporting officers.

- Employees are not permitted to add, modify or omit KPIs once they are approved by the management. Any changes should be done with instructions/guidance and proper approvals of the respective supervising officer and the reviewer.
